# Sports-Betting-Arbitrage-Bot
A bot which automates the process of finding betting odds by web scrapping and then calculates to see if there is an Arbitrage Opportunity. 
(Arbitrage means that you can bet on the two opposing sides and never lose money, but you can still make money)

For web scrapping I used Selenium to make the sure that the program takes the new updated values on various sports betting web sites.
Then I converted those odds to decimal odds and found if there is Arbitrage in those matches. Mathmatically this is a very rare chance,
and is only a thing when the implied probability is less that 100% or 1.
